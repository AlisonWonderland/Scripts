# Little caesers ordering script, a failed project
This a 'failed' attempt at making a script that can complete a Little Caesars order. I say failed only because it isn't completely human unreliant. You still need to press the captcha button.

## How to run it

## What I learned/did
* File input/output in python.
* enumerate(). Which is a built-in function that creates an iterator alongside a list, so that you can number items in the list.
* appending to a file using open(file_name, "a+"). This will create a new file if it doesn't exist and allow us to add to a file.
